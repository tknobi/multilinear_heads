# Multilinear model demo

This project demonstrates how to load and evaluate a multilinear model for different skull shapes and facial soft tissue thicknesses (FSTT) and thereby generating meshes for the skull and skin surfaces. Try the [online demo](https://graphics.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/2018/vcbm18/vcbm18.html).

In this repository we provide the full source code for evaluating the multilinear model as well as the data for a  **reduced** multilinear model with 7 parameters for skull shape and 4 parameters for FSTT distribution. Your can download the full model [here](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/record/2930619).

## Quickstart

The project is based on the [PMP library](http://www.pmp-library.org/) for mesh processing, visualization, and GUI. It is automatically downloaded as a git submodule.

Fetch the repository:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/mbotsch/multilinear_heads.git

Configure and build:

    $ cd multilinear_heads && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

Run the mesh processing app:

    $ ./mlmviewer


## Code Documentation

We provide a pre-built documentation in the `doc` directory:

    firefox multilinear_heads/doc/index.html

or using any other web browser.

You can also build the HTML documentation on your own as long as you have [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org/) installed:

    cd multilinear_heads/build/ && make doc

View the documentation by opening the file `build/html/index.html` with any web browser.


## Running the Application

After building (i.e. execution of `make`), still in the directory `build`, launch the program by executing the following command:

    ./mlmviewer <directory name where the multilinear model is stored>

or

    ./mlmviewer

which by default loads the restricted model with 7 parameters for skull shape and 4 parameters for FSTT distribution.
